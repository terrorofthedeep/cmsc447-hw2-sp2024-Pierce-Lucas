To run:
Open an IDE of your choosing, create a python virtual environment, and make sure flask and sqlite3 are installed.
You can use the existing database, or do "python createDB.py" to create database.db or reset it to its original values.
To run the app itself, do "flask run" and open localhost:5000

I got carried away and ran out of time to implement the Search user and Create user functions. Oops
